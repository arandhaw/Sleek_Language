Repo for custom programming language (temporarily named Sleek). 
Currently in progress.
The code is currently organized into a few pieces
- Lexer
- Parser
- AST 
- Symboltable
- Codegen (TBD)

As of now, the parsing of expressions, assignments, and the verification of types is implemented. Functions, while loops, if/else statements, strings and structs are also implemented. Things in progress include arrays, enums, tuples, variants, and smart pointers. Much to do!
