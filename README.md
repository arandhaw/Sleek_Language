Repo for custom programming language (temporarily named Sleek). 
Currently in progress.
The code is currently organized into a few pieces
- Lexer
- Parser
- AST 
- Symboltable
- Codegen (TBD)

As of now, the parsing of expressions, assignments, and the verification of types is implemented. 
The next step will be code generation and subsequent addition of features such as loops, if statements, heap memory, etc.
