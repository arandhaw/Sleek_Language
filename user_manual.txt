This is a quick guide to sleek syntax. 

Variables:
Built-in types: int, float, char, string, bool, none

<name> = <expression>
my_int = 10
my_float = 10.3
my_char = 't'
my_string = "ten"
my_bool = true
my_none = my_none

When a variable is created, the type is inferred. 
x = 10       # x is inferred to be integer
After creation, a variable has the same type forever.
The program won't compile if an existing variable is assigned a different type
x = 1.0      # error: x is an int, can't assign a float to int

Expressions:
Expressions can contain binary expressions, unary expressions, function calls, literals, etc

Comments: 
# this is a comment
#( this is a multi-line comment )#

Operators: 

Arithmetic operators: 
+, -, *, /, %, ^, **, //
% is modulus, ^ is exponential, ** is integer exponential, // is integer division
Unary minus: - (negates an expression)

All these operators work on integers and floats - the output type depends on operation
int + int -> int
int + float -> float
int / int -> float  # this is different from C, / is true division
int // int -> int   # if you want integer division use //
int ** int -> int   # integer exponential
int ^ int -> float  # floating point exponential

Conditional operations:
and, or, >, <, >=, <=, !=, ==
! is unary NOT operator
All of these expressions return a boolean

Order of operations:
function calls, field access (.), array indexes
{"!", unary -},
{"^", "**"},
{"*", "/", "//", "%"},
{"+", "-"},
{"==", "!=", "<=", ">=", "<", ">"},
{"and"},
{"or"}

Functions: 
All programs start from main function 
func main() -> None { 
    ... 
}

Functions have the following syntax
func <name>(<type> <name>, <type> <name>,...) -> <return-type> { 
    ...
}
If return type is none, you can omit the return type
Functions can be declared in any order

While loops:

while <condition> {
    ...
}

If/else:

if <condition> {
    ...
} else if <condition> {
    ...
} else {
    ...
}
